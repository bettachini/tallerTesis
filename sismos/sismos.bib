	abstract = {The Richter scale (), also called the Richter magnitude scale, Richter's magnitude scale, and the Gutenberg–Richter scale, is a measure of the strength of earthquakes, developed by Charles Francis Richter in collaboration with Beno Gutenberg, and presented in Richter's landmark 1935 paper, where he called it the "magnitude scale". This was later revised and renamed the local magnitude scale, denoted as {ML} or {ML} .
Because of various shortcomings of the original {ML}  scale, most seismological authorities now use other similar scales such as the moment magnitude scale (Mw ) to report earthquake magnitudes, but much of the news media still erroneously refers to these as "Richter" magnitudes. All magnitude scales retain the logarithmic character of the original and are scaled to have roughly comparable numeric values (typically in the middle of the scale). Due to the variance in earthquakes,  it is essential to understand the Richter scale uses common logarithms simply to make the measurements manageable (i.e., a magnitude 3 quake factors 10³ while a magnitude 5 quake factors 105 and has seismometer readings 100 times larger).},

Estimation of Shapley values is of interest when attempting to explain complex machine learning models. Of existing work on interpreting individual predictions, Shapley values is regarded to be the only model-agnostic explanation method with a solid theoretical foundation (Lundberg and Lee (2017)). Kernel {SHAP} is a computationally efficient approximation to Shapley values in higher dimensions, but it assumes independent features. Aas, Jullum, and Løland (2019) extend the Kernel {SHAP} method to handle dependent features, resulting in more accurate approximations to the true Shapley values. See the paper (Aas, Jullum, and Løland (2019)) for further details.},

	title = {A Twist of {PLUM}: Low-Magnitude Earthquakes and Ground-Motion-Based Early Warning},
	url = {https://www.scec.org/publication/11360},
	abstract = {We examine the earthquake detection and alerting behavior of the Propagation of Local Undamped Motion ({PLUM}) earthquake early warning ({EEW}) algorithm as applied to real-time data in 2021 from U.S. West Coast earthquakes. {PLUM} uses observations of ground motions to directly forecast shaking intensity distributions, where {PLUM}’s detection and alerting parameters have been tailored to correspond with {ShakeAlert} {EEW} alerting criteria. We find that {PLUM}’s ability to detect earthquakes depends on the station distribution, where regions of high station density can enable detection of Mw{\textless}4.5 earthquakes. Low-magnitude (Mw{\textless}4.5) earthquakes can produce potentially damaging ground motions that are of interest to {EEW} but over a spatial footprint that is usually too small for {EEW} systems to provide timely alerts. As such, the {ShakeAlert} System sets magnitude-threshold criteria for issuing alerts to the public (e.g., Mw5.0+ for alerts delivered via the Wireless Emergency Alert system). Because {PLUM} does not produce magnitude estimates during its ground-motion prediction process, there is a concern that if {PLUM} is integrated into the {ShakeAlert} System, its detections of Mw{\textless}4.5 earthquakes will lead to a significant increase in over-alerting that may negatively impact public perception of {EEW}. However, out of 291 Mw3.0+ earthquakes from January 1 to August 5, 2021, that lie within the {ShakeAlert} reporting boundaries, only 20 had ground motions large enough to activate the {PLUM} algorithm, and of those, only 13 triggered an alert for modified Mercalli intensity ({MMI}) 4.0+ shaking due to the observed shaking distribution at the time the event detection was confirmed. Of these 13 earthquakes, four were for Mw{\textgreater}4.5 events, eight had over 1,000 “Did You Feel It?” reports, and all 13 had maximum-reported intensities of {MMI}{\textgreater}4.3. We discuss why {PLUM} earthquake detections do not necessarily lead to {PLUM} {EEW} alerts and highlight {PLUM} alert performance for several of these earthquakes, including the Mw6.0 Antelope Valley earthquake.},

	abstract = {Human responses to various natural hazards have been studied for more than a few decades. However, the effects of early warning interventions that alert the population to allow them time to take protective actions are not well known, at least to an extent where it could be compared within a socio-culturally similar region under two different scenarios: events without early warning versus those where early warning is transmitted. To understand to what extent the behaviors of populations and their emotional reactions differ under these two scenarios, we compared individual responses to an earthquake with and without an earthquake early warning ({EEW}) alert of the populations’ (N = 430) from the states of Mexico, Guerrero, and Mexico City in Mexico. We considered the warnings from the Mexican Seismic Early Warning System ({SASMEX}) and private providers. Our results indicate that {EEW} potentially has implications for emotional responses and risk perception during the event and that the populations that respond to the {EEW} that provides a window of opportunity to perform protective actions, may not necessarily use the time adequately for life saving activities. On the other hand, population reactions to seismic events without any warning include evacuation during the event, which may have negative implications to their life safety. The results draw attention to the need of education of the public to events under two different circumstances – those with and without {EEW}. To further strengthen the understanding of population response, socio-technical aspects should be considered in future studies.},
