	abstract = {The Richter scale (), also called the Richter magnitude scale, Richter's magnitude scale, and the Gutenberg–Richter scale, is a measure of the strength of earthquakes, developed by Charles Francis Richter in collaboration with Beno Gutenberg, and presented in Richter's landmark 1935 paper, where he called it the "magnitude scale". This was later revised and renamed the local magnitude scale, denoted as {ML} or {ML} .
Because of various shortcomings of the original {ML}  scale, most seismological authorities now use other similar scales such as the moment magnitude scale (Mw ) to report earthquake magnitudes, but much of the news media still erroneously refers to these as "Richter" magnitudes. All magnitude scales retain the logarithmic character of the original and are scaled to have roughly comparable numeric values (typically in the middle of the scale). Due to the variance in earthquakes,  it is essential to understand the Richter scale uses common logarithms simply to make the measurements manageable (i.e., a magnitude 3 quake factors 10³ while a magnitude 5 quake factors 105 and has seismometer readings 100 times larger).},

	url = {https://www.scec.org/publication/11360},
	abstract = {We examine the earthquake detection and alerting behavior of the Propagation of Local Undamped Motion ({PLUM}) earthquake early warning ({EEW}) algorithm as applied to real-time data in 2021 from U.S. West Coast earthquakes. {PLUM} uses observations of ground motions to directly forecast shaking intensity distributions, where {PLUM}’s detection and alerting parameters have been tailored to correspond with {ShakeAlert} {EEW} alerting criteria. We find that {PLUM}’s ability to detect earthquakes depends on the station distribution, where regions of high station density can enable detection of Mw{\textless}4.5 earthquakes. Low-magnitude (Mw{\textless}4.5) earthquakes can produce potentially damaging ground motions that are of interest to {EEW} but over a spatial footprint that is usually too small for {EEW} systems to provide timely alerts. As such, the {ShakeAlert} System sets magnitude-threshold criteria for issuing alerts to the public (e.g., Mw5.0+ for alerts delivered via the Wireless Emergency Alert system). Because {PLUM} does not produce magnitude estimates during its ground-motion prediction process, there is a concern that if {PLUM} is integrated into the {ShakeAlert} System, its detections of Mw{\textless}4.5 earthquakes will lead to a significant increase in over-alerting that may negatively impact public perception of {EEW}. However, out of 291 Mw3.0+ earthquakes from January 1 to August 5, 2021, that lie within the {ShakeAlert} reporting boundaries, only 20 had ground motions large enough to activate the {PLUM} algorithm, and of those, only 13 triggered an alert for modified Mercalli intensity ({MMI}) 4.0+ shaking due to the observed shaking distribution at the time the event detection was confirmed. Of these 13 earthquakes, four were for Mw{\textgreater}4.5 events, eight had over 1,000 “Did You Feel It?” reports, and all 13 had maximum-reported intensities of {MMI}{\textgreater}4.3. We discuss why {PLUM} earthquake detections do not necessarily lead to {PLUM} {EEW} alerts and highlight {PLUM} alert performance for several of these earthquakes, including the Mw6.0 Antelope Valley earthquake.},

	abstract = {Human responses to various natural hazards have been studied for more than a few decades. However, the effects of early warning interventions that alert the population to allow them time to take protective actions are not well known, at least to an extent where it could be compared within a socio-culturally similar region under two different scenarios: events without early warning versus those where early warning is transmitted. To understand to what extent the behaviors of populations and their emotional reactions differ under these two scenarios, we compared individual responses to an earthquake with and without an earthquake early warning ({EEW}) alert of the populations’ (N = 430) from the states of Mexico, Guerrero, and Mexico City in Mexico. We considered the warnings from the Mexican Seismic Early Warning System ({SASMEX}) and private providers. Our results indicate that {EEW} potentially has implications for emotional responses and risk perception during the event and that the populations that respond to the {EEW} that provides a window of opportunity to perform protective actions, may not necessarily use the time adequately for life saving activities. On the other hand, population reactions to seismic events without any warning include evacuation during the event, which may have negative implications to their life safety. The results draw attention to the need of education of the public to events under two different circumstances – those with and without {EEW}. To further strengthen the understanding of population response, socio-technical aspects should be considered in future studies.},

	abstract = {As public awareness of climate-change-related weather events and temperature anomalies increases in the United States, citizens’ attitudes toward climate change should be studied, including the effects of climate mitigation strategies and their associated risks such as induced seismicity. Using social survey data and earthquake records, an explainable artificial intelligence method ({SHAP}) is employed to investigate factors that are important in explaining individual perceptions and assessments of future induced seismicity. Focusing on Oklahoma, where the majority (greater than 75\%) of earthquakes are induced, {SHAP} reveals that personally experiencing earthquakes is a significant factor in the respondents’ past and future perception of earthquake frequency. Realizing that induced seismicity plays a strong role in individual perceptions of earthquake frequency, it is increasingly important to mitigate this geohazard, which is expected to increase with climate mitigation strategies, whether they are carbon capture and sequestration or geothermal in nature. To this end, seismic attribute methods to improve subsurface characterization, particularly for fluid migration pathway identification, are examined using data from a carbon sequestration project in northwest Montana in the Kevin Dome area. While broadband and multispectral coherence do not improve the identification of faults and fractures, in this case, aberrancy (the third derivative of structure) successfully highlights lineations because it is more susceptible to detecting flexures in seismic data. Based on this result, we strongly encourage interpreters to include aberrancy in their reservoir analysis to identify and mitigate fluid migration that may result in induced seismicity.},

	abstract = {Theoretical equations relating the root-mean-square (rms) of the far-field ground motions with earthquake source parameters and attenuation are derived for Brune's omega-squared model that is subject to attenuation. This set of model-based predictions paves the way for a completely new approach for earthquake source parameter inversion and forms the basis for new physics-based ground motion prediction equations ({GMPEs}). The equations for ground displacement, velocity, and acceleration constitute a set of three independent equations with three unknowns: the seismic moment, the stress drop, and the attenuation parameter. These are used for source parameter inversion that circumvents the time-to-frequency transformation. Initially, the two source parameters and the attenuation constant are solved simultaneously for each seismogram. Sometimes, however, this one-step inversion results in ambiguous solutions. Under such circumstances, the procedure proceeds to a two-step approach, in which a station-specific attenuation parameter is first determined by averaging the set of attenuation parameters obtained from seismograms whose one-step inversion yields well-constrained solutions. Subsequently, the two source parameters are solved using the averaged attenuation parameter. It is concluded that the new scheme is more stable than a frequency domain method, resulting in considerably less within-event source parameter variability. The above results together with rms-to-peak ground motion relations are combined to give first-order {GMPEs} for acceleration, velocity, and displacement. In contrast to empirically based {GMPEs}, the ones introduced here are extremely simple and readily implementable, even in low-seismicity regions, where the earthquake catalog lacks strong ground motion records.},

	abstract = {Animals living within seismically active regions are subjected episodically to intense ground shaking that can kill individuals through burrow collapse, egg destruction, and tsunami action. Although anecdotal and retrospective reports of animal behavior suggest that although many organisms may be able to detect an impending seismic event, no plausible scenario has been presented yet through which accounts for the evolution of such behaviors. The evolutionary mechanism of exaptation can do this in a two-step process. The ﬁrst step is to evolve a vibrationtriggered early warning response which would act in the short time interval between the arrival of P and S waves. Anecdotal evidence suggests this response already exists. Then if precursory stimuli also exist, similar evolutionary processes can link an animal’s perception of these stimuli to its P-wave triggered response, yielding an earthquake predictive behavior. A population-genetic model indicates that such a seismic-escape response system can be maintained against random mutations as a result of episodic selection that operates with time scales comparable to that of strong seismic events. Hence, additional understanding of possible earthquake precursors that are presently outside the realm of seismology might be gleaned from the study of animal behavior, sensory physiology, and genetics. A brief review of possible seismic precursors suggests that tilt, hygroreception (humidity), electric, and magnetic sensory systems in animals could be linked into a seismic escape behavioral system. Several testable predictions of this analysis are discussed, and it is recommended that additional magnetic, electrical, tilt, and hygro-sensors be incorporated into dense monitoring networks in seismically active regions.},

There are two new and important additions. The family argument can be a {GLM} family object, which opens the door to any programmed family ({\textless}doi:10.18637/jss.v106.i01{\textgreater}). This comes with a modest computational cost, so when the built-in families suffice, they should be used instead. The other novelty is the relax option, which refits each of the active sets in the path unpenalized. The algorithm uses cyclical coordinate descent in a path-wise fashion, as described in the papers cited.},

	abstract = {Equations that predict intensity as a function of magnitude and distance are useful tools for hazard and risk assessment, and in interpretation of both contemporary and historical earthquake information. The intensity prediction equations of Atkinson and Wald (2007; hereafter {AW}07) have been remarkably successful in describing the level and intensity of motions reported under the “Did You Feel It?” ({DYFI}) program over the last several years. Examination of the performance of {AW}07 for North American earthquakes, evaluated using an extensive compiled database of {DYFI} observations from 2000 to 2013, suggests that there is little statistical basis for revising these equations. However, a problem with the {AW}07 equations is that they predict unrealistically large median intensities for large events (M {\textgreater} 6) at close distances. In this study, we revise {AW}07 to improve the intensity scaling at large magnitudes and close distances, by reconciling intensity equations with ground-motion prediction equations.},

To date, more than 750,000 responses have been compiled in the United States alone. The {DYFI} data make up in quantity what they may lack in scientific quality and offer the potential to resolve longstanding issues in earthquake groundmotion science. Such issues have been difficult to address due to the paucity of instrumental ground-motion data in regions of low seismicity. In particular, {DYFI} data provide strong evidence that earthquake stress drops, which control the strength of high-frequency ground shaking, are higher in the central and eastern United States ({CEUS}) than in California. Higher earthquake stress drops, coupled with lower attenuation of shaking with distance, result in stronger overall shaking over a wider area and thus more potential damage for {CEUS} earthquakes in comparison to those of equal magnitude in California—a fact also definitively captured with these new {DYFI} data and maps.},

	abstract = {The R function glm uses step-halving to deal with certain types of convergence problems when using iteratively reweighted least squares to ﬁt a generalized linear model. This works well in some circumstances but non-convergence remains a possibility, particularly with a nonstandard link function. In some cases this is because step-halving is never invoked, despite a lack of convergence. In other cases step-halving is invoked but is unable to induce convergence. One remedy is to impose a stricter form of stephalving than is currently available in glm, so that the deviance is forced to decrease in every iteration. This has been implemented in the glm2 function available in the glm2 package. Aside from a modiﬁed computational algorithm, glm2 operates in exactly the same way as glm and provides improved convergence properties. These improvements are illustrated here with an identity link Poisson model, but are also relevant in other contexts.},
